    description: "As superfluous as something like animation may initially seem, you can tell a lot about framework by the way that it handles the concept of time. Idiosyncrasies and race conditions in rendering reveal themselves, pauses in DOM and virtual DOM diffing can be exposed. \n\n This is one of the ways Vue shows itself to be uniquely capable and elegant as a framework. In this session, we'll cover how to use the <transition> component and some of its offerings to create fluid effects in the browser. We'll move on to watchers and transitioning state. Finally, we'll talk about lifecycle methods, asynchronous updates, and pushing our animations to the next level."

Well let's do something crazy and different! Lets make it realtime. \n\n We will take a look at the best patterns when creating an application, and how the Vue.js ecosystem can power a PWA. Extending the PWA platform we will look how Sockets and Service Workers can coexist together. Creating a PRA (Progressive Realtime Application), allowing platforms to improve the user experience without affecting the critical download chain."

No matter what your preference is, the flexibility baked into the library makes it perfect for anyone. But what about web performance? Can this flexibility still allow us to split code into asynchronous chunks?\n\nAs a maintainer of webpack, Vue.js was love at first sight for me! Because everything is a Component, everything can also be a Async Component!! This is the ultimate flexibility. Join me while we talk about all the ways to split up your Vue Application. By the time we're done, you'll walk away ready to create high performance Vue Components, Applications, and Libraries."

We’ll continue to test some simple Vue Components and see how we can effectively test and store the rendered output with snapshots.\n\n Well conclude by looking at a component that heavily relies on Vuex for it’s state management and peek into the possible directions from there."

We will understand when and how to integrate Firebase with Vue to create real time applications."

As an emerging standard, GraphQL needs the community to back the adoption and to create tools so more developers can enjoy it.\n\n Apollo is one the most popular GraphQL community project, launched by the Meteor Development Group. The Apollo Client has a very good support of the current spec and features everything you need to use the full power of GraphQL in your apps on multiple platforms.\n\n During this talk, we will learn how Apollo can help us start using GraphQL today and how some integrations in our Vue components and Vuex stores will make our lives easier."

But with a new generation of websites—single page applications—come a new set of challenges for users with disabilities, and the assistive technology they use to browse the web. Client-side routing, custom input elements, and shiny animated content: all things that screen readers can struggle with if the developer who implemented it didn't consider accessibility.\n\n During this talk, I'll explain what we as developers can do to ensure that our single page applications are usable by everyone, including people who might not use a keyboard, mouse and screen like the majority of us do. I'll show how some assistive technology is used, and demonstrate how some common mistakes we make affect people using that assistive technology."
